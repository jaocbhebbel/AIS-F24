This Python script generates all valid Tic-Tac-Toe boards that result in a win for either Player X or Player O and tracks the sequence 
of moves leading to these wins. The program systematically explores all possible board configurations, validates them based on game rules, 
and identifies winning boards while reconstructing the corresponding game sequences.

The function `is_winner` checks whether a player has achieved a winning combination on a given board. Winning conditions include completing 
any row, column, or diagonal with the same symbol (X or O). The `is_valid_board` function ensures that each board state follows the rules of 
Tic-Tac-Toe: 

- The number of X’s must equal or exceed the number of O’s by at most one.
- Both players cannot win simultaneously.
- If X wins, X must have one more move than O. If O wins, the counts of X and O must match.

The primary function, `generate_winning_sequences`, uses these validations. It employs `itertools.product` to generate all possible 
configurations of the board, with each cell being either "X," "O," or empty (" "). For each configuration, the script validates the 
board and checks if there is a winner. For valid boards with a winner, it reconstructs the sequence of moves that led to the win.

A game sequence is tracked as a series of moves, such as "Turn 1: [1, 1] - X," where `[1, 1]` represents the move on the grid,
and `X` indicates the player. Starting from an empty board, moves are applied one at a time to recreate how the game progressed 
to its final state.

The script prints examples of winning boards along with their move sequences. For instance, one output might display a game 
where X wins by completing the top row, and the sequence of moves leading to that win is detailed step-by-step. The total number of 
valid winning boards is also displayed, providing insight into the space of winning Tic-Tac-Toe games.

This script is not only a tool for understanding Tic-Tac-Toe logic but also a useful resource for AI training or game analysis.
Its flexibility allows for potential extensions, such as saving outputs to files, filtering wins by player, or adding graphical 
representations. By generating detailed training data and game sequences, this tool is well-suited for projects focused on machine
learning or exploring optimal game strategies. It provides an engaging way to analyze a simple yet strategic game.
